# SPA & API Showcase

This is an example app that showcases HTTP APIs (using Express and ASP.NET) and SPAs (using Angular 2, React and bare JS)

# Requirements
## SPA
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) + [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
### Angular 2
- [ng CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
### React
- [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)

## API
The easiest way to host a database locally without needing to install one is launching a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) Container. I am going to use a [SQL Server Express](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server) instance
TODO: Instructions for starting a database with docker.
### Express.js
- node.js + npm (see above)
- Text Editor (I recommend Visual Studio Code, but you can use anything, preferably with Syntax Highlighting)
### Asp.NET Core
- I am using .NET Core 3, which needs Visual Studio version 16.3. You can use .NET Core 2.2 but there may be differences in functionality which I am not going to cover
